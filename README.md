## Installation
Install via pip: `pip install flame-code [-U]`, see [PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/flame-code/).

The dynamic library of Python `libpython3.so` is required,
- Install `libpython<python-version>` on Debian (and its derivatives, e.g. `libpython3.11`)
- Or, `python<python-version>-libs` on RPM-based OS, e.g. `python3.11-libs`.
See the following sections for developers' guide.

## Cavity and field data

RF cavity and field-map data (`axisData_*.txt`, `Multipole*/`, curve files)
are located by the `Eng_Data_Dir` parameter.  When a lattice file does not
set it explicitly, the default is resolved in this order:

1. `Eng_Data_Dir` declared in the lattice file — always takes precedence.
2. A path baked in at build time with CMake `-DDEF_PATH=<dir>`, if that
   directory exists (e.g. the FRIB site install `/etc/flame/cavity_data`).
3. The `FLAME_DATA_DIR` environment variable, if it points to an existing
   directory.
4. The current working directory.

When the [flame-data](https://pypi.org/project/flame-data/) package is
installed (it ships the same cavity data as the other flame releases),
`import flame` sets `FLAME_DATA_DIR` to its `cavity_data` directory, so
pip-installed FLAME works out of the box without any `DEF_PATH`.  An
`FLAME_DATA_DIR` already exported by the user is left unchanged; a
`DEF_PATH` build always prefers its own site path.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

Needs boost headers.  Also the boost-system and boost-python libraries.
Also python and numpy headers.
The nosetests test runner is used for 'make test' if present.

```sh
apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
 libboost-thread-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
 libboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
 libboost-test-dev \
 build-essential cmake bison flex cppcheck git libhdf5-dev \
 python-numpy python-nose python3-numpy python3-nose
```
Supports Python 3.6+

### Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/flame-simulation/FLAME.git flame
mkdir flame/build
cd flame/build
cmake ..
make
```

To build with a specific python version, change the cmake invokation to:

```sh
cmake .. -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3.11
```

### Running tests

```sh
make test
```

Please attach ```Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log``` when reporting test failures.
